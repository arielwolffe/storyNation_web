                The images that form in the mind of the child while writing a story can be physically visualized allowing for clearer and easier flow of the plot. Seeing a story come to life can also trigger new ideas or additional ideas for the same story, such as a different ending or change in character. 
                    <br />
                    <br />StoryNation would allow the child to personalize their story while changing the plot and characters as they desire.
